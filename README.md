To connect the ps4 controller to the esp32, you have to install the Sixaxis pair tool using a windows based laptop(cant install the app on mac os), and then plug your ps4 controller into the computer to get the MAC adress of the ps4 controller. Then You have to modify the MAC adress of your ps4 controller to be the same as the esp32's. If you want more details, the github of the ps4controller library has very good explanation.
